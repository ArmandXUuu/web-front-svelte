		<h1>About this site - How I deploied it?</h1>
		<p>
			First I bought a cool domain and chose Cloudflare as the DNS provider. One of it's benefit is
			that I cantake advantage of the edge network that comes with Cloudflare and its protection
			features.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then it's time to choose techniques for front-end and back-ends, and then deploy them. From my
			internship experience this is not difficult, I rented a virtual machine <i
				>(pretty low performance beacuse I'm poor)</i
			>
			and set <code>Docker</code> on it.
			<br />
		</p>

		<p>So the general structure is shown in this figure:</p>

		<div style="text-align: center">
			<a href="schema.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
				<img src="schema.png" alt="The strcture of my site" style="width: 90%;" /></a

	<secton id="app">
		<h1>About this app</h1>

		<p>
			This is a <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> app. You can make your own by typing the
			following into your command line and following the prompts:
		</p>

		<pre>npm create svelte@latest</pre>

		<p>
			The page you're looking at is purely static HTML, with no client-side interactivity needed.
			Because of that, we don't need to load any JavaScript. Try viewing the page's source, or
			opening the devtools network panel and reloading.
		</p>

		<p>
			The TODOs page illustrates SvelteKit's data loading and form handling. Try using it with
			JavaScript disabled! (I deleted this shit)
